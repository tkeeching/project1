## Game Logic
1. Game play
- The game starts with player 1 making the first move by clicking on any of the nine tiles, a digit '1' is assigned to the corresponding cell on the game board which is stored in an array that consists of three 1x3 array.
- Check is immediately carried out to determine if there is a winner
- Player 2 makes their first move, a digit '2' is assigned to the corresponding cell which is stored in the above-mentioned array. 
- Check for winner
- Player 1 makes their next move
- step 2 to 5 is repeated until,
    - a winner is determined. in this case, game play will terminate immediately and no futher move is allowed. Or,
    - if all nine tiles are occupied and there is no winner, it is a draw and the game play terminates.

2. Check winner logic
- The logic to check for winner is broken in four parts,
    - Part 1 - Check rows - interate through each row, if a row consist of 3 '1's - winner is player 1, if a row consists of 3 '2's - winner is player 2.
    - Part 2 - Check columns - the game board is transposed and stored under a new variable. The columns now become the rows. A similar checking algorithm used in Part 1 is applied here to check for winner.
    - Part 3 - Check forward diagonal - the cells in the forward diagonal are being checked by utilising their row and column indices respectively which happened to be identical in each grid, ie. [0][0], [1][1] and [2][2] for a 3x3 grids. If those cells consist of 3 '1's - winner is player 1, if they consist of 3 '2's - winner is player 2.
    - Part 4 - Check backward diagonal - the cells in the backward diagonal are being checked by hardcording their row and column indices. If those cells consist of 3 '1's - winner is player 1, if they consist of 3 '2's - winner is player 2.


## Unsolved Problems
1. Implementation of scoreboard
2. Implementation of training mode that allows player to play against computer.
